    <h2 id="culture"> Culture</h2>
    <p> A company culture that facilitates employee happiness means lower turnover and better company performance.
        Employees are loyal and companies perform better. It's a win-win. If your company ramps up to more employees,
        the culture will become a self-selecting mechanism for employees and candidates.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>People</li>
        <p>Our team members came from various background, ranging from top notch university graduates as well as
            experienced hire
            from Unicorns in Indonesia</p>

        <li>Working Hours</li>
        <p>A flexible schedule allows an employee to work hours that differ from the normal company start and stop time.
            Particularly in an environment for exempt employees,
            those hours are generally 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. or 9 a.m. - 6 p.m. and tallied, they total a 40-hour workweek.
            (Any regularly scheduled work hours allow an extra hour for lunch whether the employee takes the time or
            not.)</p>

        <li>Annual Leaves</li>
        <p>Annual leave is paid time off work granted by employers to employees to be used for whatever the employee
            wishes.
            Depending on the employer's policies, differing number of days may be offered,
            and the employee may be required to give a certain amount of advance notice, may have to coordinate with
            the employer to be sure that staffing is adequately covered during the employee's absence, and other
            requirements may have to be met.
            The vast majority of countries today mandate a minimum amount of paid annual leave by law,
            though the United States is a notable exception in mandating no minimum paid leave and treating it as a perk
            rather than a right.</p>
        <li>Atmosphere</li>
        <p> GoWork is Indonesiaâ€™s leading premium coworking space with a mission to help people be their best.
            We provide world-class workspaces that are
            inspiring and fully equipped with amenities and tools to help companies thrive.</p>
